# HTML
- Start by making basic HTML elements youll need for the images.
    * Make a div container that is going to be your gameboard.

    * Create divs for each image your going to use.
        ~ This would look something like this
```html
<div>
    <div class="front-of-card"> Image of front of card </div>
    <div class="back-of-card"> Image of back of card</div>
</div>
```
            
* Create a folder to hold your images so it will be easier to work with.

    * PROPERLY!!! Name your divs with id's and classes. (You really need to make this clear and coherent)

     # CSS
- Start to lay out a basic CSS grid for your gameboard.
    * Fiddle with some styles to space out each image appropriately.
        
    * Make sure things are evenly spaced and it looks good.

    * Research some basic animations to make the cards flip around.



# JavaScript
- Create const variables to link your HTML elements.
    * Variable for your cards

- Create functions where needed.
    * Going to need a randomizing function that changes the order of your images.

    * Youll need a function that compares 2 cards to see if they are a match.

    * 

- Create EventListeners.
    * Well need an event listener for when the user clicks a card.
